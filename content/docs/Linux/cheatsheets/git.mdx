<Callout>Git is the free and open source distributed version control system that's responsible for everything GitHub
related that happens locally on your computer.</Callout>

### Setup

#### Configuring user information used across all local repositories

```bash
git config --global user.name "[firstname lastname]"
```
Set a name that is identifiable for credit when reviewing version history.

```bash
git config --global user.email "[valid-email]"
```
Set an email address that will be associated with each history marker.

```bash
git config --global color.ui auto
```
Set automatic command line coloring for Git for easy reviewing.

### Setup & Init

#### Configuring user information, initializing and cloning repositories

```bash
git init
```
Initialize an existing directory as a Git repository.

```bash
git clone [url]
```
Retrieve an entire repository from a hosted location via URL.

### Stage & Snapshot

#### Working with snapshots and the Git staging area

```bash
git status
```
Show modified files in the working directory, staged for your next commit.

```bash
git add [file]
```
Add a file as it looks now to your next commit (stage).

```bash
git reset [file]
```
Unstage a file while retaining the changes in the working directory.

```bash
git diff
```
Diff of what is changed but not staged.

```bash
git diff --staged
```
Diff of what is staged but not yet committed.

```bash
git commit -m "[descriptive message]"
```
Commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot.

### Branch & Merge

#### Isolating work in branches, changing context, and integrating changes

```bash
git branch
```
List your branches. A `*` will appear next to the currently active branch.

```bash
git branch [branch-name]
```
Create a new branch at the current commit.

```bash
git checkout [branch-name]
```
Switch to another branch and check it out into your working directory.

```bash
git merge [branch]
```
Merge the specified branch’s history into the current one.

```bash
git log
```
Show all commits in the current branch’s history.

### Share & Update

#### Retrieving updates from another repository and updating local repos

```bash
git remote add [alias] [url]
```
Add a git URL as an alias.

```bash
git fetch [alias]
```
Fetch down all the branches from that Git remote.

```bash
git merge [alias]/[branch]
```
Merge a remote branch into your current branch to bring it up to date.

```bash
git push [alias] [branch]
```
Transmit local branch commits to the remote repository branch.

```bash
git pull
```
Fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch.

### Tracking Path Changes

#### Versioning file removes and path changes

```bash
git rm [file]
```
Delete the file from the project and stage the removal for commit.

```bash
git mv [existing-path] [new-path]
```
Change an existing file path and stage the move.

```bash
git log --stat -M
```
Show all commit logs with an indication of any paths that moved.

### Temporary Commits

#### Temporarily store modified, tracked files in order to change branches

```bash
git stash
```
Save modified and staged changes.

```bash
git stash list
```
List stack-order of stashed file changes.

```bash
git stash pop
```
Write working from the top of stash stack.

```bash
git stash drop
```
Discard the changes from the top of stash stack.

### Rewrite History

#### Rewriting branches, updating commits, and clearing history

```bash
git rebase [branch]
```
Apply any commits of the current branch ahead of the specified one.

```bash
git reset --hard [commit]
```
Clear staging area, rewrite working tree from the specified commit.

### Inspect & Compare

#### Examining logs, diffs, and object information

```bash
git log
```
Show the commit history for the currently active branch.

```bash
git log branchB..branchA
```
Show the commits on branchA that are not on branchB.

```bash
git log --follow [file]
```
Show the commits that changed the file, even across renames.

```bash
git diff branchB...branchA
```
Show the diff of what is in branchA that is not in branchB.

```bash
git show [SHA]
```
Show any object in Git in human-readable format.

### Ignoring Patterns

#### Preventing unintentional staging or committing of files

```bash
git config --global core.excludesfile [file]
```
Set a system-wide ignore pattern for all local repositories.

Create a `.gitignore` file with patterns like:

```bash
logs/
*.notes
pattern*/
```

This file will prevent unintentional staging or committing of files that match these patterns.
