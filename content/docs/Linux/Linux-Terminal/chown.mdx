#### chown Command Reference

The `chown` command is used to change the ownership of files or directories. You can specify the new owner, group, or both, and also use a reference file for the change. It is especially useful for adjusting ownership when managing file permissions and security.

#### Syntax

```bash
chown [options]... NewOwner File...
chown [options]... :Group File...
chown [options]... --reference=RFILE File...
```

- **NewOwner**: Specifies the new owner and/or group. It can be:
  - **OWNER**: Just the username or numeric user ID.
  - **OWNER.GROUP** or **OWNER:GROUP**: Both the owner and the group are changed.
  - **OWNER.** or **OWNER:**: Only the owner is changed, and the group is set to the owner's login group.
  - **.GROUP** or **:GROUP**: Only the group is changed.

#### Options

- **`-c`, `--changes`**: Verbosely describe the action for each file whose ownership changes.
  ```bash
  sudo chown -c Ursula /Users/Shared/MyFile.txt
  ```

- **`--dereference`**: Operate on the files the symbolic links point to, not the links themselves.
  ```bash
  sudo chown --dereference Ursula /path/to/symlink
  ```

- **`-f`, `--silent`, `--quiet`**: Suppress error messages for files whose ownership cannot be changed.
  ```bash
  sudo chown -f Ursula /path/to/file
  ```

- **`-h`, `--no-dereference`**: Act on symbolic links themselves (default behavior).
  ```bash
  sudo chown -h Ursula /path/to/symlink
  ```

- **`--reference=FILE`**: Use the user and group of a reference file instead of specifying NewOwner.
  ```bash
  sudo chown --reference=/path/to/referencefile /path/to/file
  ```

- **`-R`, `--recursive`**: Recursively change ownership of directories and their contents.
  ```bash
  sudo chown -R Ursula /Users/Shared/tmp/
  ```

- **`-v`, `--verbose`**: Verbosely describe the action or non-action taken for each file.
  ```bash
  sudo chown -v Ursula /Users/Shared/MyFile.txt
  ```

#### Examples

- **Change the owner of a file**:
  ```bash
  sudo chown Ursula /Users/Shared/MyFile.txt
  ```

- **Recursively change ownership of everything in a directory**:
  ```bash
  sudo chown -R Ursula:staff /Users/Shared/tmp/
  ```

- **Change ownership of only hidden files in a directory**:
  To avoid issues with symbolic links, use this command:
  ```bash
  sudo chown -R audrey /Work/.[^.]* 
  ```
