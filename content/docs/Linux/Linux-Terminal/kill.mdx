title: Kill

The `kill` command in Unix-like systems is used to send signals to processes. It can be used to terminate processes, stop them, or even send specific signals to change their behavior. Below is a breakdown of the usage and examples:

### Syntax:
```bash
kill [-s sigspec] [-n signum] [-sigspec] jobspec or pid
kill -l [exit_status]
kill -l [sigspec]
```

### Key Options:
- `-l`: List all signal names.
- `-s`: Send a specific signal (can be either signal name or number).
- `-n`: Send a signal by its number.

If no signal is specified, `SIGTERM` (signal 15) is used by default to terminate the process.

### Signals:
- **SIGTERM (15)**: Default signal used by `kill`, requests a graceful shutdown.
- **SIGKILL (9)**: Forcefully terminates the process (cannot be caught or ignored).
- **SIGINT (2)**: Interrupts a process, typically triggered by pressing `Ctrl + C`.
- **SIGHUP (1)**: Hangup signal, often used to tell a daemon to reload its configuration.
- **SIGSTOP (17,19,23)**: Stops a process temporarily (can be resumed later).
- **SIGABRT (6)**: Used by programs to abort execution.

### Common Examples:

1. **Kill a Process**:
   First, identify the process using `ps` or any other method to get its PID (Process ID).
   ```bash
   ps
   PID TTY      TIME CMD
   1293 pts/5    00:00:00 MyProgram
   ```

   Then, use the `kill` command to terminate it:
   ```bash
   kill 1293
   ```

   If successful, the output will be:
   ```bash
   [2]+ Terminated MyProgram
   ```

2. **Force Kill a Process (SIGKILL)**:
   If the process does not respond to `SIGTERM`, you can forcefully kill it with `SIGKILL` (signal number 9):
   ```bash
   kill -9 1293
   ```

3. **Send a Custom Signal**:
   You can send a custom signal to a process. For example, to send `SIGSTOP` (to pause the process):
   ```bash
   kill -s SIGSTOP 1293
   ```

4. **List All Signals**:
   To list all available signal names:
   ```bash
   kill -l
   ```

5. **Kill a Process After a Delay**:
   Run a command in the background, then kill it after a delay of 5 seconds:
   ```bash
   my_command & sleep 5
   kill -0 $! && kill $!
   ```

   The `$!` variable holds the PID of the last background process.
