#### fuser 
Identify processes using files or sockets, optionally killing the process that is accessing the file.

### Syntax:
```bash
fuser [-a|-s|-c] [-4|-6] [-n space ] [-k [-i] [-signal ] ] [-muvf] name
fuser -l
fuser -V
```

### Options:

#### **-a**
Show all files specified on the command line. By default, only files that are accessed by at least one process are shown.

#### **-c**
Same as `-m` option, used for POSIX compatibility.

#### **-f**
Silently ignored, used for POSIX compatibility.

#### **-k**
Kill processes accessing the specified file.  
If not specified with `-signal`, `SIGKILL` is sent.  
An `fuser` process will never kill itself, but it can kill other `fuser` processes.  
The effective user ID of the process executing `fuser` is set to its real user ID before attempting to kill.

#### **-i**
Ask for confirmation before killing a process. This is ignored unless `-k` is also used.

#### **-l**
List all known signal names.

#### **-m name**
Specifies a file or file system that is mounted.  
All processes accessing files on that file system will be listed.  
If a directory is specified, it is automatically treated as `name/`.

#### **-n space**
Select a different namespace:  
- `file` (default) for files.  
- `udp` for local UDP ports.  
- `tcp` for local TCP ports.  
You can specify a shortcut like `80/tcp` for specific ports.

#### **-s**
Silent operation. The options `-u` and `-v` are ignored in this mode.  
The `-a` option cannot be used with `-s`.

#### **-signal**
Specify a signal to use instead of `SIGKILL` when killing processes (e.g., `-HUP` or signal number).  
This is ignored unless used with `-k`.

#### **-u**
Append the username of the process owner to each PID.

#### **-v**
Verbose mode.  
Processes are shown in a `ps`-like format with fields such as `PID`, `USER`, `COMMAND`, `ACCESS`.  
If the access is by the kernel (e.g., a swap file), `kernel` is shown instead of the PID.

#### **-V**
Display version information.

#### **-4**
Search only for IPv4 sockets.  
This must not be used with `-6` and only affects `tcp` and `udp` namespaces.

#### **-6**
Search only for IPv6 sockets.  
This must not be used with `-4` and only affects `tcp` and `udp` namespaces.

#### **-**
Reset all options and revert the signal back to `SIGKILL`.

### Output:
`fuser` outputs a list of PIDs for processes that are using the specified files or file systems. The type of access is indicated by a letter after the file name:
- `c` - Current directory.
- `e` - Executable being run.
- `f` - Open file.
- `F` - Open file for writing.
- `r` - Root directory.
- `m` - Memory-mapped file or shared library.

If multiple processes access the same file, only one entry will be shown for each access type. If a file is specified multiple times, some entries may be omitted.

### Examples:

1. **Kill all processes accessing the `/home` directory**:
```bash
$ fuser -km /home
```

2. **List the process (or processes) locking a file**:
```bash
$ fuser -f /path/to/file
```

3. **Check if no process is using `/dev/ttyS1` before running a command**:
```bash
$ if fuser -s /dev/ttyS1; then :; else something; fi
```

4. **Show processes using the local TELNET port (assuming port 23)**:
```bash
$ fuser 23/tcp
```

5. **Show processes accessing a specific file and display verbose output**:
```bash
$ fuser -v /path/to/file
```

### Restrictions:
- **Privileges**: `fuser` requires root privileges to display information about processes owned by other users. Without elevated privileges, information may be incomplete.
- **Kernel access**: Processes accessing kernel resources may only be shown with the `-v` option.
- **UDP and TCP**: `fuser` works with both IPv6 and IPv4 for `udp` and `tcp` namespaces, but the address fields for TCP and UDP can only accept IPv4 addresses.

### Files:
- **Location of the proc file system**: `/proc`
