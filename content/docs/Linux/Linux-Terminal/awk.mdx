#### AWK (GNU AWK)

AWK, or gawk (GNU AWK), is a powerful text-processing tool that can be used for text search, modification, and reporting tasks. It is widely used for extracting and manipulating data in files and streams.

#### Syntax

```bash
awk <options> 'Program' Input-File1 Input-File2 ...
awk -f PROGRAM-FILE <options> Input-File1 Input-File2 ...
```

#### Options

- **-F FS**  
  `--field-separator FS`  
  Use FS for the input field separator (the value of the `FS` predefined variable).

- **-f PROGRAM-FILE**  
  `--file PROGRAM-FILE`  
  Read the awk program source from the file `PROGRAM-FILE`, instead of from the first command line argument.

- **-mf NNN**  
  **-mr NNN**  
  These flags set the maximum number of fields (`-mf`) and the maximum record size (`-mr`). These are ignored by `gawk` since it has no predefined limits.

- **-v VAR=VAL**  
  `--assign VAR=VAL`  
  Assign the variable `VAR` the value `VAL` before program execution begins.

- **-W traditional**  
  `--traditional`  
  Use compatibility mode, where `gawk` extensions are turned off.

- **-W lint**  
  `--lint`  
  Issue warnings about dubious or non-portable awk constructs.

- **-W lint-old**  
  `--lint-old`  
  Warn about constructs not available in the original V.7 Unix version of awk.

- **-W posix**  
  `--posix`  
  Use POSIX compatibility mode, turning off `gawk` extensions and applying additional restrictions.

- **-W re-interval**  
  `--re-interval`  
  Allow interval expressions in regular expressions.

- **-W source=PROGRAM-TEXT**  
  `--source PROGRAM-TEXT`  
  Use `PROGRAM-TEXT` as the awk program source code, allowing mixing command-line source code with file-based code.

- **--**  
  This signals the end of options, ensuring that further arguments can be passed to the awk program itself.

#### Program Structure

An AWK program consists of patterns and actions. Each pattern triggers an action when matched.

```bash
pattern { action }
```

For example, to display lines from a file that contain the string "123", "abc", or "some text":

```bash
awk '/123/ { print $0 }
     /abc/ { print $0 }
     /some text/ { print $0 }' samplefile
```

#### Special Patterns

- **/Regular Expression/**  
  Matches any input record containing the specified text.
- **Pattern && Pattern**  
  Logical AND between patterns.
- **Pattern || Pattern**  
  Logical OR between patterns.
- **! Pattern**  
  Logical NOT for a pattern.
- **Pattern ? Pattern : Pattern**  
  Conditional expression (if, then, else).
- **Pattern1, Pattern2**  
  A range from Pattern1 to Pattern2.
- **BEGIN**  
  Executes before the input file is read.
- **END**  
  Executes after the input file is read.

#### Built-in Variables

- **CONVFMT**  
  Format used for converting numbers (default: `%.6g`).
- **FS**  
  Field separator for input (default is space or tab).
- **NF**  
  Number of fields in the current record.
- **NR**  
  Ordinal number of the current record.
- **FNR**  
  Ordinal number of the current record in the current file.
- **FILENAME**  
  Name of the current input file.
- **RS**  
  Input record separator (default is newline).
- **OFS**  
  Output field separator (default is space).
- **ORS**  
  Output record separator (default is newline).
- **OFMT**  
  Output format for numbers (default is `%.6g`).
- **SUBSEP**  
  Separator for multiple subscripts (default is `034`).
- **ARGC**  
  Argument count (assignable).
- **ARGV**  
  Array of arguments, assignable; non-null members are taken as filenames.
- **ENVIRON**  
  Array of environment variables.

#### Examples

1. Print the fifth item from each line of an `ls -l` listing:

```bash
ls -l | awk '{print $5}'
```

2. Print the row number and the first item from each line:

```bash
awk '{print NR "- " $1 }' samplefile.txt
```

3. Print the first item and the third-last item from each line:

```bash
awk '{print $1, $(NF-2) }' samplefile.txt
```

4. Remove blank lines from a file:

```bash
awk 'NF > 0' data.txt
```

5. Print the length of the longest input line:

```bash
awk '{ if (length($0) > max) max = length($0) }
      END { print max }' data.txt
```

6. Print seven random numbers from 0 to 100:

```bash
awk 'BEGIN { for (i = 1; i <= 7; i++) print int(101 * rand()) }'
```

7. Print the total number of bytes used by files:

```bash
ls -lg FILES | awk '{ x += $5 } ; END { print "total bytes: " x }'
```

8. Print the average file size of all `.PNG` files in a directory:

```bash
ls -l *.png | gawk '{sum += $5; n++;} END {print sum/n;}'
```

9. Count the lines in a file:

```bash
awk 'END { print NR }' data.txt
```

#### Comparison with grep

- `grep` searches files for lines that match a pattern, whereas `awk` performs actions on matching lines.
- Example: To search for the word "Dec" in a file:

```bash
grep Dec filename
```

- To search for the word "Dec" in the sixth field using `awk`:

```bash
awk '$6 == "Dec"' filename
```
