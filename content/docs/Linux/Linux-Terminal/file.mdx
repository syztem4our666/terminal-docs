#### Determine file type.

Syntax  
```bash
file [-bchikLNnprsvz0] [--apple] [--mime-encoding] [--mime-type] [-e testname]  
      [-F separator] [-f namefile] [-m magicfiles] file ...  
```  
```bash
file -C [-m magicfiles]  
```  
```bash
file [--help]  
```

Key

- `-b`, `--brief`  
  Do not prepend filenames to output lines (brief mode).
  
- `-C`, `--compile`  
  Write a magic.mgc output file that contains a pre-parsed version of the magic file or directory.
  
- `-c`, `--checking-printout`  
  Cause a checking printout of the parsed form of the magic file. This is usually used in conjunction with the `-m` flag to debug a new magic file before installing it.
  
- `-e`, `--exclude testname`  
  Exclude the test named in testname from the list of tests made to determine the file type. Valid test names are:
  
  - `apptype`: EMX application type (only on EMX).
  - `text`: Various types of text files (this test will try to guess the text encoding, irrespective of the setting of the 'encoding' option).
  - `encoding`: Different text encodings for soft magic tests.
  - `tokens`: Look for known tokens inside text files.
  - `cdf`: Print details of Compound Document Files.
  - `compress`: Check for, and looks inside, compressed files.
  - `elf`: Print ELF file details.
  - `soft`: Consult magic files.
  - `tar`: Examine tar files.
  
- `-F`, `--separator separator`  
  Use the specified string as the separator between the filename and the file result returned. Defaults to `:`.

- `-f`, `--files-from namefile`  
  Read the names of the files to be examined from `namefile` (one per line) before the argument list. Either `namefile` or at least one filename argument must be present; to test the standard input, use `-` as a filename argument.

- `-h`, `--no-dereference`  
  Option causes symlinks not to be followed (on systems that support symbolic links). This is the default if the environment variable `POSIXLY_CORRECT` is not defined.

- `-i`, `--mime`  
  Causes the file command to output mime type strings rather than the more traditional human-readable ones. Thus it might say `'text/plain; charset=us-ascii'` rather than `'ASCII text'`. In order for this option to work, file changes the way it handles files recognized by the command itself (such as many of the text file types, directories etc.), and makes use of an alternative 'magic' file.

- `--mime-type`, `--mime-encoding`  
  Like `-i`, but print only the specified element(s).

- `-k`, `--keep-going`  
  Don’t stop at the first match, keep going. Subsequent matches will have the string `'\012- '` prepended. (If you want a newline, see `-r`)

- `-L`, `--dereference`  
  Option causes symlinks to be followed, as the like-named option in `ls` (on systems that support symbolic links). This is the default if the environment variable `POSIXLY_CORRECT` is defined.

- `-m`, `--magic-file magicfiles`  
  Specify an alternate list of files and directories containing magic. This can be a single item, or a colon-separated list. If a compiled magic file is found alongside a file or directory, it will be used instead.

- `-N`, `--no-pad`  
  Don’t pad filenames so that they align in the output.

- `-n`, `--no-buffer`  
  Force stdout to be flushed after checking each file. This is only useful if checking a list of files. It is intended to be used by programs that want filetype output from a pipe.

- `-p`, `--preserve-date`  
  On systems that support `utime(2)` or `utimes(2)`, attempt to preserve the access time of files analyzed, to pretend that file never read them.

- `-r`, `--raw`  
  Don’t translate unprintable characters to `\ooo`. Normally file translates unprintable characters to their octal representation.

- `-s`, `--special-files`  
  Normally, file only attempts to read and determine the type of argument files which `stat(2)` reports are ordinary files. This prevents problems because reading special files can have peculiar consequences. Specifying the `-s` option causes file to also read argument files which are block or character special files. This is useful for determining the filesystem types of the data in raw disk partitions, which are block special files. This option also causes file to disregard the file size as reported by `stat(2)` since on some systems it reports a zero size for raw disk partitions.

- `-v`, `--version`  
  Print the version of the program and exit.

- `-z`, `--uncompress`  
  Try to look inside compressed files.

- `-0`, `--print0`  
  Output a null character `\0` after the end of the filename. Nice to `cut(1)` the output. This does not affect the separator which is still printed.

- `--help`  
  Print a help message and exit.

Files

```bash
/usr/share/misc/magic.mgc  Default compiled list of magic.  
/usr/share/misc/magic      Directory containing default magic files.  
```

Return Code

- `file` returns 0 on success, and non-zero on error.  
- If the file named by the file operand does not exist, cannot be read, or the type of the file named by the file operand cannot be determined, this is not considered an error that affects the exit status.  
- `file` uses several algorithms that favor speed over accuracy, thus it can be misled about the contents of text files.

Examples

```bash
$ file file.c file /dev/{wd0a,hda}  
file.c:   C program text  
file:     ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), stripped  
/dev/wd0a: block special (0/0)  
/dev/hda: block special (3/0)  
```

```bash
$ file -s /dev/wd0{b,d}  
/dev/wd0b: data  
/dev/wd0d: x86 boot sector  
```

```bash
$ file -s /dev/hda{,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}  
/dev/hda: x86 boot sector  
/dev/hda1: Linux/i386 ext2 filesystem  
/dev/hda2: x86 boot sector  
/dev/hda3: x86 boot sector, extended partition table  
/dev/hda4: Linux/i386 ext2 filesystem  
/dev/hda5: Linux/i386 swap file  
/dev/hda6: Linux/i386 swap file  
/dev/hda7: Linux/i386 swap file  
/dev/hda8: Linux/i386 swap file  
/dev/hda9: empty  
/dev/hda10: empty  
```

```bash
$ file -i file.c file /dev/{wd0a,hda}  
file.c: text/x-c  
file: application/x-executable  
/dev/hda: application/x-not-regular-file  
/dev/wd0a: application/x-not-regular-file  
```
