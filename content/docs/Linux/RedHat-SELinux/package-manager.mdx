#### Install Software Using Package Managers
<Callout>Package managers are centralized methods of accessing software repositories. Using package managers for installing and updating software removes many opportunities for user error and automates numerous installation steps.  
On RHEL, DNF is the default package manager, but you will also see RPM.</Callout>

#### Install a package with dnf
To install a package, use the `dnf install` command. Here's an example for installing `nmap`:

```bash
dnf -y install nmap
```
You can verify the installation with the `dnf list` command:

```bash
dnf list nmap
```

#### Updating a package
To list available updates, use the following command:

```bash
dnf list updates
```

The `list` subcommand is useful for finding out which packages have available updates on the system. Here's an example of the output:

```bash
dnf list updates

<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
Available Upgrades
bash.x86_64              4.4.20-2.el8                               rhui-rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rhui-rpms
chrony.x86_64            4.1-1.el8                                  rhui-rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rhui-rpms
systemd.x86_64           239-51.el8_5.3                             rhui-rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rhui-rpms
<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
```

Many packages on this system have updates available. Specifying a package name with `dnf update` will constrain this operation to only look for that package.
<Callout>If you instead want to make sure your entire system is up to date, running `dnf update` without any other arguments will apply updates for all packages on your system (including YUM itself)</Callout>

#### Using `dnf history` to Roll Back a Transaction

The `history` subcommand provides a summary of recent `dnf` transactions.

```bash
dnf history
```

The output contains transaction IDs in the first column, which are used to reference specific locations in the transaction history when executing rollbacks.

```bash
ID| Command                  | Date and time    | Action(s) | Altered
------------------------------------------------------------------
12 | -y remove httpd           | 2021-12-22 01:12 | Removed  |   10
11 | -y update bash            | 2021-12-22 01:12 | Upgrade  |    1
10 | -y install wireshark      | 2021-12-22 01:07 | Install  |   98
 9 | install -y httpd          | 2021-12-22 01:04 | Install  |   10  <
 8 |                           | 2021-12-22 01:02 | I, U     |   81 >
 7 | install -y git            | 2021-09-03 15:10 | Install  |   48
```

This subcommand is also useful for rolling back transactions if you erroneously install or update a package, as it cleans up all of the dependencies associated with the package.  
For example, to roll back the state of your system to before you uninstalled `httpd`, use the following command:

```bash
dnf -y history rollback 12
```

<Callout>The number `12` specifies that the rollback will return the system to the state it was in at transaction ID 12, or before you removed `httpd`.</Callout>

#### Using RPM to Run Detailed Queries

<Callout>DNF is the standard package manager, but that doesn't mean that RPM is obsolete. Detailed queries can be carried out using RPM with the query option (`-q`). This section will walk you through three examples of how to use this option.</Callout>

#### Listing Files Installed by a Package

You can combine the `-q` option with the list option (`-l`) to display all of the files installed by a specific package. This information is hidden by default to keep the package installation process simple, but it is often useful to know where specific files are located.

```bash
rpm -ql wireshark
```

**Example Output**:
```bash
/usr/bin/wireshark
```

Now you can see that the `Wireshark` application is located at `/usr/bin/wireshark`.

#### Listing Installation Scripts

Some packages run scripts to finish their installation process. The `--scripts` option can be used in combination with `rpm -q` to return the contents of these post-installation scripts for a specific package. `Wireshark` does not have post-install scripts, so let's try this with the `httpd` package.

```bash
rpm -q --scripts httpd
```

**Example Output**:
```bash
# Scriptlets installed for httpd:
postinstall script: /usr/libexec/httpd/httpd-post-install
```

The output shows a script that creates a preset for the `httpd` service behind the scenes when the package is installed.

#### Showing Changelog

You can use the `--changelog` option with `rpm -q` to display recent changes in a package.

```bash
rpm -q --changelog wireshark
```

**Example Output**:
```bash
* Tue Feb 2 2021 Wireshark Development Team - 3.2.4-1
- Bug fix for UDP dissector crash
- Improved handling of malformed packets
```
This command shows the changelog for the specified package, listing what has recently changed in the package.

#### Validating Package Files Using `rpm`

If a program is suddenly misbehaving, it could be related to key files not being installed properly. `rpm` has a validation option (`-V`) that compares the local files with the expected files for the package. 

#### Test Example: Missing File in Wireshark

Remove a file from the `Wireshark` package to test out this validation functionality:

```bash
rm -f /usr/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/wireshark.png
```

Use the `-V` option with `rpm` to check the file status of `Wireshark`:

```bash
rpm -V wireshark
```

**Example Output**:
```bash
missing     /usr/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/wireshark.png
```

Now that you can see there is a missing file, reinstall the `Wireshark` package to return it to its proper state:

```bash
dnf -y reinstall wireshark
```

**Example Output**:
```bash
Arch   Version        Repository                        Size
===================================================================
Reinstalling:
wireshark
x86_64 1:2.6.2-12.el8 rhel-9-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms 3.7 M
```

Check that `wireshark.png` has been restored:

```bash
ls /usr/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/
wireshark.png
```

#### Validating Changes in Package Files

The command `rpm -V` is useful for more than just finding missing files. This command can also inform you if any files have changed since installation. 

To test this out, run the validation command on the `PAM` package:

```bash
rpm -V pam
```

**Example Output**:
```bash
S.5....T.  c /etc/pam.d/password-auth
S.5....T.  c /etc/pam.d/system-auth
```
