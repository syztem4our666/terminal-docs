#### Common Diskpart Commands

#### 1. Work with Disks:

- `list disk`  
  Lists all disks connected to your system, showing their size and status.
  
  ```sh
  list disk
  ```

- `select disk disk_number`  
  Selects a specific disk by its number for further operations. Replace `disk_number` with the actual disk number (e.g., `select disk 0`).
  
  ```sh
  select disk 0
  ```

- `detail disk`  
  Displays detailed information about the selected disk, including its partitions, status, and size.
  
  ```sh
  detail disk
  ```

- `clean`  
  Removes all partitions and data from the selected disk, essentially resetting it to an "uninitialized" state.
  
  ```sh
  clean
  ```

- `convert mbr|gpt`  
  Converts the selected disk to MBR (Master Boot Record) or GPT (GUID Partition Table). This operation erases all partitions on the disk.
  
  ```sh
  convert mbr
  ```
  or
   ```sh
  convert gpt
  ```

---

#### 2. Work with Partitions (After selecting a disk):

- `list partition`  
  Lists all partitions on the selected disk.
  
  ```sh
  list partition
  ```

- `select partition partition_number`  
  Selects a specific partition on the selected disk. Replace `partition_number` with the partition number (e.g., `select partition 1`).
  
  ```sh
  select partition 1
  ```

- `create partition primary size=5000`  
  Creates a primary partition with a size of 5000 MB. If no size is specified, it will take up all unallocated space.
  
  ```sh
  create partition primary size=5000
  ```

- `create partition extended size=20000`  
  Creates an extended partition. This partition type allows you to create logical partitions within it.
  
  ```sh
  create partition extended size=20000
  ```

- `create partition logical size=10000`  
  Creates a logical partition within the extended partition, using the specified size.
  
  ```sh
  create partition logical size=10000
  ```

- `delete partition`  
  Deletes the selected partition.
  
  ```sh
  delete partition
  ```

---

#### 3. Formatting and Assigning Letters to Partitions:

- `format fs=ntfs quick`  
  Formats the selected partition with the NTFS file system using a quick format.
  
  ```sh
  format fs=ntfs quick
  ```

- `assign letter=D`  
  Assigns a drive letter to the selected partition, making it accessible through Windows Explorer.
  
  ```sh
  assign letter=D
  ```

- `remove letter=D`  
  Removes the assigned letter from the selected partition.
  
  ```sh
  remove letter=D
  ```

---

#### 4. Partition Modifications:

- `extend`  
  Extends the selected partition into any unallocated space available after it. If no size is specified, the partition will use all available space.
  
  ```sh
  extend
  ```

- `shrink desired=5000`  
  Shrinks the selected partition by the specified amount (5000 MB in this case), creating unallocated space.
  
  ```sh
  shrink desired=5000
  ```

- `active`  
  Marks the selected partition as active. Only one partition can be active at a time, and it is used to boot the operating system.
  
  ```sh
  active
  ```

- `inactive`  
  Marks the selected partition as inactive.
  
  ```sh
  inactive
  ```

---

#### 5. Working with Volumes (Dynamic Disks):

Volumes are different from basic partitions. On dynamic disks, a volume can span multiple partitions or disks.

- `list volume`  
  Lists all volumes on the system, whether they are on basic or dynamic disks.
  
  ```sh
  list volume
  ```

- `select volume volume_number`  
  Selects a volume for further operations. Replace `volume_number` with the volume number (e.g., `select volume 1`).
  
  ```sh
  select volume 1
  ```

- `detail volume`  
  Shows detailed information about the selected volume, including file system and size.
  
  ```sh
  detail volume
  ```

- `delete volume`  
  Deletes the selected volume.
  
  ```sh
  delete volume
  ```
