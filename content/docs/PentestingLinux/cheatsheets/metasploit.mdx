### Metasploit
<Callout>The Metasploit Framework is a Ruby-based penetration testing platform that writing, testing, and executing exploit code.
Metasploit contains a suite of tools to test security vulnerabilities, enumerate networks, execute attacks, and evade detection.</Callout>

#### **Importing External Exploits into MSFConsole**

The default directory where all the modules, scripts, plugins, and `msfconsole` proprietary files are stored is `/usr/share/metasploit-framework`. Alternatively, you can use the folder `/home/username/.msf4`. To import a module, you just need to copy it into one of the previous folders and use the `reload_all` command. Alternatively, you can load a module at runtime by using `loadpath /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/`.

### MSFVenom
Here is the cheatsheet of [MSFVenom](https://pentopsvault.vercel.app/docs/CheatSheets/msfvenom)

### Metasploit Meterpreter

#### Base Commands:

```shell
? / help              # Display a summary of commands
exit / quit           # Exit the Meterpreter session
sysinfo               # Show the system name and OS type
shutdown / reboot     # Self-explanatory
```

#### File System Commands:

```shell
cd                    # Change directory
lcd                   # Change directory on local (attacker's) machine
pwd / getwd           # Display current working directory
ls                    # Show the contents of the directory
cat                   # Display the contents of a file on screen
download / upload     # Move files to/from the target machine
mkdir / rmdir         # Make / remove directory
edit                  # Open a file in the default editor (typically vi)
```

#### Process Commands:

```shell
getpid                # Display the process ID that Meterpreter is running inside
getuid                # Display the user ID that Meterpreter is running with
ps                    # Display process list
kill                  # Terminate a process given its process ID
execute               # Run a given program with the privileges of the process the Meterpreter is loaded in
migrate               # Jump to a given destination process ID
```

#### Network Commands:

```shell
ipconfig              # Show network interface information
portfwd               # Forward packets through TCP session
route                 # Manage/view the system's routing table
```

#### Misc Commands:

```shell
idletime              # Display the duration that the GUI of the target machine has been idle
uictl [enable/disable] [keyboard/mouse]  # Enable/disable either the mouse or keyboard of the target machine
screenshot            # Save as an image a screenshot of the target machine
```

#### Additional Modules:

```shell
use [module]          # Load the specified module
                      # Example: use priv (Load the priv module)
hashdump              # Dump the hashes from the box
timestomp             # Alter NTFS file timestamps
```

### Managing Sessions

#### Multiple Exploitation:

Run the exploit expecting a single session that is immediately backgrounded:

```shell
msf > exploit -z
```

Run the exploit in the background expecting one or more sessions that are immediately backgrounded:

```shell
msf > exploit –j
```

#### List all current jobs (usually exploit listeners):

```shell
msf > jobs –l
```

#### Kill a job:

```shell
msf > jobs –k [JobID]
```

### Multiple Sessions:

#### List all backgrounded sessions:

```shell
msf > sessions -l
```

#### Interact with a backgrounded session:

```shell
msf > session -i [SessionID]
```

#### Background the current interactive session:

```shell
meterpreter > <Ctrl+Z>
or
meterpreter > background
```

#### Routing Through Sessions:

All modules (exploits/post/aux) against the target subnet mask will be pivoted through this session.

```shell
msf > route add [Subnet to Route To] [Subnet Netmask] [SessionID]
```
