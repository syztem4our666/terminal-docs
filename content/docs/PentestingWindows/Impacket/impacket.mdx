## Impacket-lookupsid 
We can fetch some usernames through Windows SID bruteforcing. To do this we can use impacket's lookupsid as guest. The same command can also be run as anonymous.
```bash
impacket-lookupsid <USERNAME>@<IP> -no-pass -domain-sids | grep -i SidTypeUser
```


## Impacket-dcomexec

The `impacket-dcomexec` command is part of the Impacket toolkit and is used to execute commands on remote Windows systems via DCOM (Distributed Component Object Model) protocol.

### Syntax

```bash
impacket-dcomexec [options] <target> <command>
```
Example:

```bash
impacket-dcomexec -object MMC20 DOMAIN/USERNAME:'PASSWORD'@10.10.11.4 'PAYLOAD' -silentcommand 
```
### Options

- `-object MMC20`: Specifies the object to be invoked via DCOM. In this case, it's using MMC20, which is typically associated with Microsoft Management Console (MMC).
- `-silentcommand`: Executes the specified command silently without displaying any output on the target system.
- Other options can include authentication parameters, such as username and password, if required.
